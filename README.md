# Project Using Flask and Mongo

The code uses FastApi (Flask) for REST purposes.

The code can run after install all the requirements as provided in the folder.
The requirements can be installed using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Another requirement would be to have a MongoDB installed on the PC with the connection mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/ as shown in main.py.

Simply run uvicorn main:app --reload in the folder with main.py to turn on the server

Then open up your browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:8000

There you will see the documentation using FastApi. The POST and GET methods can be tested there

### If there are any issues running the code or would like me to show how it works, please don't hesitate to email or call

Thank you
